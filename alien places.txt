-name: StarSeed
	-you seed the GAN based on your wallet
	-space implications
	-cool name

-an NFT is seeded by a wallet's public ID and the current week/day/sm of issuance
	-it is thus deterministic
-the derived seed is hashed and plugged into the GAN
-it should be essentially impossible for two seeds to be equal

-a person should definitely be able to preview the NFT
-BUT it will be heavily watermarked, probably a tasteful "STARSEED" in the middle

-sample eth address:
0x6239eb3102218F53D4B3413e2d58E114C4C62caE


ARCHITECTURE CONSIDERATIONS
-try starting with a higher LR on the generator, but decaying at a faster rate
-learns to geenrate good images faster, but later fine-tunes while the discriminator
better learns to differentiate niche things


BUSINESS CONSIDERATIONS

-TO SEED THE GENERATOR:
< contract address >< "NELL" >< recepient address >< UTC Release Date YYYY/MM/DD >

-try to register domain as an ETH address

-create twitter to display generated art that gets sold from the pool
-at the beginning, i will mint the art and then sell it on a marketplace
	-try to raise awareness this way
