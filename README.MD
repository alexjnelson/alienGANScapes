# Alien GANScapes
This project was created to generate images for a gallery of AI-generated art. The theme of the pieces is "out-of-this-world" landscapes. To generate these pieces, a [generative adversarial neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network (GAN)) was trained on a dataset of otherworldly images. The dataset was created by scraping web sources for images of various landscapes on Earth which are very rare, such as [Socotra Island](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/socotra-yemen-biodiversity-photography). To train this model yourself to generate images of up to 1024x1024 pixels, it is recommended that you have GPU RAM of at least 16GB.
